#cpp sfml

It is a ping pong game, which I create after some tutorial in SFML.
It have a issue, and ball sometimes going through walls because there is no delta time.

I will not repair it. It is old one, I though I lost it. I spend a lot of tim to fighure out how to do everything, before i discovery books about things like that :)
